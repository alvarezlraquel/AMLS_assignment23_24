# AMLS_assignment23_24


This project aims to explore machine learning and deep learning techniques for categorizing data from two medical imaging datasets. Task A focuses on the binary classification within the PneumoniaMNIST dataset, while Task B addresses the challenge of multi-class classification using the PathMNIST dataset.

The project folder AMLS_23-24_SN20100899 contains:
- Folder: "A", containing the code files for Task A models
- Folder: "B", containing the code files for Task B models
- A Datasets folder intended for dataset files PneumoniaMNIST.npz and PathMNIST.npz.
- main.py: A script that initiates a menu for selecting and running tasks.
- README.md: Provides a description of the project and instructions for executing the code.

# Required Packages 
- numpy: For calculations and numerical functions
- matplotlib: For data visualisation
- seaborn: For advanced data visualisation 
- sklearn: For data preprocessingand evaluation metrics of our models
- tensorflow and keras: For designing and training CNN models
